                <p>In this project, I built a data pipeline using AWS services. First, data is stored in Amazon S3, which acts as a staging area. Next, I used AWS Glue to clean and transform the data through an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. After the data is prepared, an AWS Glue crawler automatically scans it and sends it to Amazon Athena, where it can be queried easily. Finally, the processed data is visualized in Amazon QuickSight, allowing the client to gain insights and make informed decisions.</p>
           <p>Scalability and Operational Efficiency:

           <br> <b>On-Demand Scalability:</b> The use of AWS Glue for ETL and crawlers, along with Amazon Athena for querying, allows the pipeline to scale according to the volume of data and query load, accommodating changing requirements without significant manual intervention.
            
        <br><b> Low Operational Overhead:</b> This orchestration minimizes the need for extensive management and maintenance efforts, allowing your team to focus on data insights rather than infrastructure management.
            
       <br> <b>Good Latency:</b> Despite the slightly higher costs, the combination of these services ensures efficient processing and querying, delivering insights quickly to support informed decision-making.</p>

                <p>To create the above dashboard, I utilized Tableau Public, which offers an extremely user-friendly interface. This dashboard primarily focuses on analyzing yearly car sales and comparing them to the previous year to identify improvements in sales. Initially, I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as year-to-date total sales, year-to-date car sales, and year-to-date average sales.

                    Following that, I proceeded to create trends in sales on a week-to-week basis using Line graph. This was accompanied by a pie chart illustrating the sales data based on the body styles of cars that were sold the most. Additionally, a donut chart was used to display which colors of cars were sold more frequently.
                    <br>
                   <br> Moving on to the next section, the dashboard presents year-to-date dealer data, showcasing the business conducted by dealers categorized by region. Finally, there is a table displaying the types of company cars sold annually and the total business conducted categorized by the company whose cars were sold.
                    <br>
                   <br> On the left side of the dashboard, there are filters available. These filters allow users to customize the data displayed based on their preferences.
