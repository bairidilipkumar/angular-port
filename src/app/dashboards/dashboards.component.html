                <p>In this project, I built a data pipeline using AWS services. First, data is stored in Amazon S3, which acts as a staging area. Next, I used AWS Glue to clean and transform the data through an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. After the data is prepared, an AWS Glue crawler automatically scans it and sends it to Amazon Athena, where it can be queried easily. Finally, the processed data is visualized in Amazon QuickSight, allowing the client to gain insights and make informed decisions.</p>

                <p>To create the above dashboard, I utilized Tableau Public, which offers an extremely user-friendly interface. This dashboard primarily focuses on analyzing yearly car sales and comparing them to the previous year to identify improvements in sales. Initially, I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as year-to-date total sales, year-to-date car sales, and year-to-date average sales.

                    Following that, I proceeded to create trends in sales on a week-to-week basis using Line graph. This was accompanied by a pie chart illustrating the sales data based on the body styles of cars that were sold the most. Additionally, a donut chart was used to display which colors of cars were sold more frequently.
                    <br>
                   <br> Moving on to the next section, the dashboard presents year-to-date dealer data, showcasing the business conducted by dealers categorized by region. Finally, there is a table displaying the types of company cars sold annually and the total business conducted categorized by the company whose cars were sold.
                    <br>
                   <br> On the left side of the dashboard, there are filters available. These filters allow users to customize the data displayed based on their preferences.

                <p>To create the above dashboard, I utilized Tableau Public. This HR dashboard focuses on monitoring employee dynamics within the company, including new hires, departures, reasons for leaving, job satisfaction levels, and employee backgrounds.

                    <br>Starting with key performance indicators (KPIs), the dashboard displays the total number of employees in the company, the active rate, attrition count, and attrition percentage. Additionally, it includes a gender-based filter to analyze the demographics of employees leaving the company.
                    <br>
                   <br> The first visual element is a pie chart illustrating department-wise attrition rates. This is followed by bar graphs depicting the distribution of employees across different age groups. A table presents data on job satisfaction levels based on employee ratings.

                    <br>The next section begins with a bar chart showcasing attrition rates in various education fields, followed by a donut chart highlighting attrition rates by gender across different age groups.

                     <br>
                    <br>Next, the dashboard displays a breakdown of profits by subcategory items within the store, followed by insights into which months of the year saw higher profits and losses.

                   <br> A donut chart visualizes the sum of quantities sold by category, categorizing sales data into furniture, electronics, and clothing. Following that, a bar graph identifies states where the business performed well, and a final donut chart showcases the distribution of payments modes used by customers.
