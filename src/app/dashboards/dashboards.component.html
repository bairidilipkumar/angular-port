                <p>Building dashboards with a "passion over data" approach which mean focusing  on creating visually appealing, engaging, and user-friendly designs with prioritizing data accuracy, complexity, or quantity. From my professional experience, I have worked extensively on building dashboards. This involved utilizing SSAS services and conducting ETL operations, including the development and maintenance of pipelines.</p>

                <p>To create the above dashboard, I utilized Tableau Public, which offers an extremely user-friendly interface. This dashboard primarily focuses on analyzing yearly car sales and comparing them to the previous year to identify improvements in sales. Initially, I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as year-to-date total sales, year-to-date car sales, and year-to-date average sales.

                    Following that, I proceeded to create trends in sales on a week-to-week basis using Line graph. This was accompanied by a pie chart illustrating the sales data based on the body styles of cars that were sold the most. Additionally, a donut chart was used to display which colors of cars were sold more frequently.
                    <br>
                   <br> Moving on to the next section, the dashboard presents year-to-date dealer data, showcasing the business conducted by dealers categorized by region. Finally, there is a table displaying the types of company cars sold annually and the total business conducted categorized by the company whose cars were sold.
                    <br>
                   <br> On the left side of the dashboard, there are filters available. These filters allow users to customize the data displayed based on their preferences.

                <p>To create the above dashboard, I utilized Tableau Public. This HR dashboard focuses on monitoring employee dynamics within the company, including new hires, departures, reasons for leaving, job satisfaction levels, and employee backgrounds.

                    <br>Starting with key performance indicators (KPIs), the dashboard displays the total number of employees in the company, the active rate, attrition count, and attrition percentage. Additionally, it includes a gender-based filter to analyze the demographics of employees leaving the company.
                    <br>
                   <br> The first visual element is a pie chart illustrating department-wise attrition rates. This is followed by bar graphs depicting the distribution of employees across different age groups. A table presents data on job satisfaction levels based on employee ratings.
                    <br>
                    <br>The next section begins with a bar chart showcasing attrition rates in various education fields, followed by a donut chart highlighting attrition rates by gender across different age groups.
